## ðŸ’« What Does it do?

Hyper Ores adds a few late-game tools and armor pieces that are 2 to 5x better than normal netherite. Hyper ores are very rare to find with only 6 veins max spawning per chunk, and only 3 ores in each vein! However, if you cant find any hyper ores, you can alawys craft it.. But its not so cheap. Just like any vanilla ore, hyper ore has its own solid block, which can be used for decoration, or changing your beacon color to a red-greenish mix!

Hyper ore offers many hard-to-obtain tools and armor that will be worth your time grinding for, keeping you active, just a bit longer!

## ðŸ“ƒ Fabric Support is _**NOT**_ Currently Available!
We are planning to being working on the fabric port shortly, with the fabric port will also become the main mod and the newest updated (to 1.21.1 at the time). Meaning, when we release the fabric version, the forge versions will become deprecated!

*(Current Plan, Not Offical yet.)
